# f0_writer
ENUNU extension that reads Mode2 UST tuning and transfers it to F0.
 
# How to Use
### As an extension
1. Paste the `f0_writer` folder into the voicebank of choice.
2. Append the text written in `enuconfig.yaml` at the end of the existing `enuconfig.yaml` of the voicebank.
	- If the voicebank in question already has this part in its `enuconfig.yaml`, you may edit the `acoustic_editor` section to be similar to the given `enuconfig.yaml`.
3. The extension can be disabled by opening the `options.json` file and setting the `enabled` option to `false`

**Note:** This extension only works on UTAU ENUNU, not like you need this in OpenUtau ENUNU anyway.

### Through terminal
Extensions in ENUNU are done by passing arguments to each possible extension. This extension takes the F0 CSV file and UST file generated by ENUNU. This extension can then be invoked in this manner:

```
python script.py --f0 "path/to/f0" --must "path/to/ust"
```

# Remarks
This extension was made really quickly as a test for the most part. So far I have not encountered any errors in its ways, but it could happen! If you open the code and see the huge amount of classes, that is [pyUtau](https://github.com/UtaUtaUtau/pyUtau), which is my own library for reading USTs sent by plugins. I wouldn't usually want to do this, but the ways that portable Python works didn't allow me to import packages/libraries from the same directory. I tried everything but this is the easiest option by far... so I hope you don't mind. I would've used [utaupy](https://github.com/oatsu-gh/utaupy) but I've already coded the bulk in pyUtau and I was testing outside the extension context. If you're curious why, here's why:

As the quick description says this only reads Mode2 tuning! I didn't make it read Mode1 tuning because I just don't want to deal with the mess that is Mode1... Most people tune in Mode2 now anyways.
